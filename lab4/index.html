		<h3>Lab's Subject</h3>
		<p>The idea for this lab was to get in the habit of thinking in terms
		of pseudocoding before jumping right into coding.</p>

		<div class="work">
			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<h4>Robert</h4>
			<p>I didn't run into any challenges with this Lab.</p>
			<h4>Stephanie</h4>
			<p>This lab was pretty much straight forward. The only challenge I had was
			figuring out how to turn things into JS comments. After I asked my partner
			about the comments and how to figure out the indentation, everything was
			a bit more clearer.</p>
			<h3>Problems</h3>
			<h4>Robert</h4>
			<p>I'm getting more used to Atom and teletype so this lab went pretty smooth.</p>
			<h4>Stephanie</h4>
			<p>I didn't really run into any problems for this lab. Still getting used
			to working with Atom once again and figuring things out. I'm pretty sure
			for future labs everything will run smoothly.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
