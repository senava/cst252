			<h3>Lab's Subject</h3>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on our
			computer and add index.html files.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>For this lab, I didn't really run into any problems. It was pretty easy
			creating the file structure, so I got the hang of it prett quick. The only
			struggle me and my partner really had was just being able to collaborate
			on the same file strucutre within Atom. We ran into a few difficulties
			but were able to figure things out.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>If everything done correctly, this is the final look for this lab. You
			should be able to see the final product.</p>
