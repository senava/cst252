			<h3>Lab's Subject</h3>
			<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on our
			computer and add index.html files.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>For this lab, I didn't really run into any problems. It was pretty easy
			creating the file structure, so I got the hang of it prett quick. The only
			struggle me and my partner really had was just being able to collaborate
			on the same file strucutre within Atom. We ran into a few difficulties
			but were able to figure things out.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>If everything done correctly, this is the final look for this lab. You
			should be able to see the final product.</p>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>My main challenge for this Lab was working with Atom and writing css
			without auto-complete like there is in Dreamweaver. I had a problem where
			my image was showing locally but wasnt showing on the hosted site. I've never
			ran into this issue before, I think it's because I'm used
			to Dreamweaver writing my filepaths for me, but other than that and some issues
			with teletype this lab went good.</p>
