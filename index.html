				<p class="info">I am a shy but friendly person. I find it difficult for

				Chicana and first generation college student. </p>

					<h3 class="headings">Learning New Things</h3>
					<p class="info">This semester I am excited to learn a lot of new techniques
					in this course. Some of the things I am looking forward to is being able
					to learn about Javascript and how I can incorporate it to my webpage. I am
					excited to make this site my own and have it represent my personality and
					interests.</p>

					<h3 class="headings">What's in store for the futre?</h3>
					<p class="info">With my web development knowledge, hopefully I will be
					able to incorporate everything I have learned to create a fully working
					and accessible site. Another thing I hope I will be able to do is create
					a site that is unique and different from all the other sites, nothing that
					seems ordinary, depending on what kind of site I am creating.</p>
