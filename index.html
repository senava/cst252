			<h3>Here is a bit about who I am/ what I am like.</h3>
			<p>I am a shy but friendly person. I find it difficult for myself to
			start conversations, but I try my best to have them. (Even though they
			might not last very long.) I am a proud Chicana and first generation
			college student. I like to play videogames and watch streams on Twitch.
			I have two siblings, who are a handful to be around but I am very proud of
			them. There are lots more things that I like, but these are just a few.</p>

			<h3 class="headings">Learning New Things</h3>
			<p class="info">This semester I am excited to learn a lot of new techniques
			in this course. Some of the things I am looking forward to is being able
			to learn about Javascript and how I can incorporate it to my webpage. I am
			excited to make this site my own and have it represent my personality and
			interests.</p>

			<h3 class="headings">What's in store for the futre?</h3>
			<p class="info">With my web development knowledge, hopefully I will be
			able to incorporate everything I have learned to create a fully working
			and accessible site. Another thing I hope I will be able to do is create
			a site that is unique and different from all the other sites, nothing that
			seems ordinary, depending on what kind of site I am creating.</p>
