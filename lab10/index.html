            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p id="challenge">For this lab I did run into a few challenges. <br></br>
            First of all, I totally forgot what we did for Lab 7, so I had to
            revisit that lab and recall what I did. After checking that, I was
            able to recall what the lab was about and how everything worked.<br></br>
            Secondly, I had a bit of a struggle figuring out how to remove the
            window prompt from showing up, but after viewing the console, I was
            able to figure out how to get rid of it. Fun fact, I didn't require
            that line for this lab.<br></br>
            Everything after that went pretty smoothly and I didn't seem to run
            into any more challenges.<br></br>
            P.S I had to figure all of this out without a partner because I wasn't
            able to find one for this lab. Hopefully I can get a partner for upcoming
            labs. ^-^</p>
            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <p id="problem">The only problem I had was figuring out how to borrow
            the sort() function from lab 7 and getting things to work out. But after
            checking the console and playing around with a few things, I was able
            to get everything done.</p>
