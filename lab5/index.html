					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>I didn't really run into any challenges for this lab. It was pretty
					straight forward but there were some experimenting here and there. Such as
					using document.writeln and having it to show up in the browser. We ended
					up figuring out what was going on. My partner added an extra "+" on his
					side of the output, but after that everything was well.</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>Didn't really have any problems happen. Just a minor hold up with the
					JavaScript file. Nothing like double checking to make sure everything is
					good.</p>

					<h3>Robert's Corner</h3>
					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>I didn't have any challenges with this lab, it was fun getting back
					into JS.</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>I had a syntax error (extra +) which prevented us from seeing our
					output initialy. This was discovered in the console and fixed.</p>
