			<h3>Lab's Subject</h3>
			<p>For this lab we had to work with our partner and experiment with
			JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>

					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>I dind't really run into any challenges with this lab, but I did have
					to pay extra attention to what I was typing into the JS file and seeing
					that everything was written correctly.</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>I had a syntax error on my part which prevented me from seeing my
					output on the page. I checked and checked everything on the file and
					everything seemed perfectly fine until I noticed I was missing a
					parenthesis within my document.writeln. I discovered this after checking
					our professor's JavaScript file he had added onto his lab 6 page.</p>

					<h3>Robert's Corner</h3>
					<h4>Challenges</h4>
					<p>I didn't have any challenges with this lab. Everything worked as
					expected.</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>I didnt read the instructions close enough for task 1 and I
					accidentley made both of the variables arrays so I had to redo this
					portion of the lab. Other than that the rest of the lab went relatively
					problem free.</p>

				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>You should be able to access this page if done correctly. Such as
				seeing the index.html file we have created + the program execution.</p>
